<p>I’ll say it up front: I’m a Steelers fan. And even though George Pickens isn’t wearing black and gold anymore, I still believe he deserves to be in the top-five receiver conversation — and it’s time to clear up the false narratives holding him back.

  First, context matters. Pickens hasn’t had the luxury of elite quarterback play like Jefferson with Cousins, Chase with Burrow, or A.J. Brown with Hurts. In Pittsburgh, he spent most of his snaps trying to haul in passes from a carousel of inconsistent QBs. Despite that, he produced over 2,000 yards in his first two seasons, including a breakout 1,140-yard campaign in 2023 where he led the NFL in yards per catch (18.1). That wasn’t volume; that was pure efficiency in an offense that didn’t consistently put him in position to shine.
  
  Then there’s the injury. Pickens came into the league with questions after tearing his ACL at Georgia, and critics have clung to that like it’s a permanent weakness. But he came back stronger, didn’t lose a step, and has stayed healthy enough to play at a high level week after week. The “injury risk” label feels more like lazy recycling of old scouting reports than a fair evaluation of what he’s shown in the NFL.
  
  And don’t forget the flags that robbed him of moments. In 2023, against Pat Surtain II — one of the league’s best corners — Pickens beat him deep for a game-changing touchdown. But a questionable holding call on the offensive line erased it. Plays like that don’t show up in stat sheets, but they tell the story of how thin the margins have been between Pickens being respected as elite versus dismissed as “inconsistent.”
  
  That leads to the narrative problem. Too often, Pickens is painted as a “diva receiver,” as if his swagger and competitiveness are somehow negatives. The truth is, he plays with the edge you want in a No. 1 wideout. He’s physical, he doesn’t back down, and yes, he wants the ball — because he knows what he can do with it. If anything, the narrative around him has been unfairly tilted by frustration with Pittsburgh’s offense rather than his actual play.
  
  Now in Dallas, paired with Dak Prescott and CeeDee Lamb, Pickens finally has the chance to silence the noise. He’s always had the size, the hands, and the ability to make circus catches look routine. What he hasn’t had is the stability around him. With that piece in place, I believe the numbers will match the talent — and the league will finally have to admit what some of us already know: George Pickens belongs in the top-five receiver conversation.
  
  Because love him or hate him, there’s one thing you can’t ignore — when the ball’s in the air, there aren’t five guys in the NFL you’d take over George Pickens.</p>
