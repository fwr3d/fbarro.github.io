<p>When the Patriots drafted Drake Maye third overall in 2024, the spotlight hit him instantly. Fans wanted to see him under center right away. But instead of rushing him onto the field, the team made a deliberate choice: let Jacoby Brissett start Week 1, and let Maye sit.
  For a lot of rookies, being benched feels like rejection. For Maye, it became part of his foundation. He got to watch Brissett handle the huddle, manage pressure, and absorb the grind of an NFL week. Every snap he didn’t play, he studied. Every mistake Brissett made, Maye learned without paying the price on the field.
  That patience didnt last forever. By Week 6, with the Patriots off to a rough 1 and 4 start, coach Jerod Mayo made the move. He said Maye gave the team “the best chance to win now and going forward.” And when Maye took over, you could see the difference the bench time had made. He wasn’t wide-eyed, he wasn’t reckless. He looked like someone who had been quietly preparing for this moment since draft night.
  For me, thats what makes his story stand out. The bench wasnt punishment. It was preparation. And in a league where rookies often get thrown into the fire too fast, Maye showed the value of slowing things down, learning first, and then stepping in ready.</p>
