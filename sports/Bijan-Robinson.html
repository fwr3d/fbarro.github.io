        <p>Bijan Robinson has quickly become one of the NFL’s premier running backs and the centerpiece of the Atlanta Falcons’ offense. Drafted 8th overall in 2023 after a stellar career at Texas where he won the Doak Walker Award and earned unanimous All-American honors, Robinson entered the league with high expectations and has lived up to them. His rookie season showed flashes of his dual-threat potential, but in 2024 he established himself as a true force, finishing with 1,456 rushing yards, 14 touchdowns on the ground, and another 431 receiving yards—nearly 1,900 yards from scrimmage. Ranked third in the NFL in rushing, Robinson combined volume with efficiency, carrying the ball with a mix of power, vision, and elusiveness while also contributing as a reliable pass-catcher. What sets him apart is his completeness: he can punish defenses inside, bounce outside for explosive gains, and line up as a receiving threat. While quarterbacks dominate the MVP conversation, NFL Media analysts have even labeled him the Falcons’ most realistic candidate for the award going into 2025. Robinson himself downplays the talk, calling it “just noise,” but his production speaks loudly enough—he’s not just a backfield weapon, he’s the engine that makes Atlanta’s offense go.</p>
