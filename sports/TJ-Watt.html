<p>T.J. Watt has built his legacy as one of the most dominant defensive players of his generation. Drafted 30th overall by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2017, Watt has carried on the family legacy — his brother J.J. being a three-time Defensive Player of the Year — while carving out a reputation that stands on its own. From the moment he arrived in Pittsburgh, he became the cornerstone of the Steelers' defense, combining relentless effort, technique, and athleticism.

  His accolades speak for themselves: 2021 Defensive Player of the Year, multiple First-Team All-Pro selections, and a tie for the NFL's single-season sack record with 22.5 sacks in 2021. Watt's game is built on explosiveness off the edge, violent hands, and uncanny timing. He doesn't just sack quarterbacks — he creates turnovers, swatting balls, forcing fumbles, and swinging games with a single play.
  
  What sets Watt apart is consistency. Year after year, when he's on the field, he produces at an elite level, often carrying the Steelers' defense on his back. Injuries have cost him stretches of time, but whenever he's healthy, Pittsburgh's defense transforms from solid to terrifying. He embodies the Steelers' culture — tough, relentless, and disruptive — and he's widely regarded as one of the most impactful defenders in football today.</p>
